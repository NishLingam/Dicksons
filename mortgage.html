                        Take all the legwork out of finding the most suitable mortgage deal for you. We have all the
                        information "under one roof". If you prefer, our adviser can even come to your home or office by
                        arrangement, as they are equipped with laptop computers. And we are open longer hours than the
                        usual banks and building societies for your convenience.

                    <h2> Cost Planning Services </h2>
                    <p class="para">
                        Whether you are a first time purchaser or a seasoned mover, costs and charges have changed over
                        the years and it may be very useful to sit down with a friendly adviser, with no obligation, to
                        establish the up front costs of your proposed move, and monthly costs thereafter. Our advisers
                        will be pleased to help with these and any other related questions you may have before you go
                        house hunting.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Mortgage Decisions </h2>
                    <p class="para">
                        A remarkable computerized mortgage search system which is updated daily, and has detailed
                        information on over 2000 mortgages available through about 125 lenders, including all the high
                        street names you know. This guarantees you access to the most competitive deals around and helps
                        our adviser pinpoint the most suitable one for you..
                    </p>
                    <h2> What will it cost to You..?</h2>
                    <p class="para">
                        We will not normally charge you anything for our services as we usually receive an introduction
                        payment from the chosen lender and/or Legal & General in respect of any life assurance you take
                        connected with the mortgage. This would be similar to the amount received by the lender if you
                        went direct. Therefore there is no additional cost to you whatsoever for our independent
                        mortgage advice service.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Customers Service Team </h2>
                    <p class="para">
                        We have a dedicated mortgage administration and customer services team to take over all the
                        hassles of seeing your mortgage proceeds as quickly and smoothly as possible. They will see your
                        application through to offer stage, liaising with your solicitor, estate agent and the lender as
                        necessary, and be on hand from 9 am to 5.30pm weekdays to help you.
